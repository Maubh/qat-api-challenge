3. run `npm run cy:open` to run the API tests
4. run `npm run cy:run` to run the tests in headless mode

If you want to check the mochawesome reports, please follow these steps:
1. run `npm run cy:run` to run the tests in headless mode
2. run `npm run report:merge` to copy the test execution information to a json file
3. run `npm run report:mocha` to generate a html report
